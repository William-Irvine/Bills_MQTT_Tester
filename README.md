# Bills_MQTT_Tester
Simple .NET MAUI app for Android to connect to an MQTT Broker and write a JSON message to a topic using MQTTnet. 

I built this app using .NET MAUI and MQTTnet so that I could test functionality of saving data submitted via the app to a Postgres Database through an MQTT Broker running an a Raspberry Pi 4.
